# openai-codex-tempgraph
A program written by OpenAI Codex with minimal input after original prompt

Its just basic html and js, so opening the index.html in a browser works fine.

The prompt I gave Codex was as follows:

/* HTML, CSS and Javascript */
/*
The following is a application written using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It gets the longitude and latitude of a cityname the user enters in an input from openstreetmaps API
it gets the historical daily max temperature (temperature_2m_max) from the archive-api.open-meteo.com API
It presents the temperature data it recieves in a graph with the Three.js library
It uses CSS Grid for the layout.
*/

The only thing I had to edit was that it didnt sort the result properly. Besides that everything is generated by Codex.
